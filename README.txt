This code takes arclength values from an electron diffraction experiment setup
and outputs a graph of Sin(Î¸) of the corresponding arclength vs. plancks cons-
tant divided by the momentum of the particle, in order to find the slope, and
from this the lattice spacing between the atoms that diffracted the electrons
